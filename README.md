# Project objective
  The telecommunications industry faces persistent challenges with high customer attrition, commonly known as churn, with annual rates often exceeding 20%. Given that acquiring a new customer is significantly more costly than retaining an existing one, predicting and preventing voluntary churn is a top business priority for maintaining profitability and market share. The objective of this project is to develop a robust, data-driven solution for customer retention by leveraging the Telco Customer Churn dataset provided by Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). This initiative involves a multi-step analytical approach: (1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key demographic, service, and account-related factors that correlate strongly with churn, such as contract type and monthly charges; (2) Statistical Churn Analysis to quantify the impact of specific features; and (3) Predictive Modeling using classification algorithms, like Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to accurately forecast which individual customers are most likely to discontinue their service. The ultimate goal is to generate actionable insights and a reliable model that enables the company to target high-risk customers with proactive, personalized retention offers, thereby minimizing revenue loss and optimizing retention spending.
